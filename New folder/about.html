    <pre style="font-size: x-large; color: rgb(24, 22, 22); ">Origami is the art of folding paper into a sculpture without using glue or scissors.
This may seem like a daunting task, but it's entirely possible to fold paper into 
very sophistocated and beautiful designs. My website aims to help people create 
origami and experience the satisfation and joy in making origami.

    <h2>More information on origami</h2>

    <p style="align-self: flex-end; color: rgb(24, 22, 22); font-size: x-large;"> Through the study of origami, 
        an interdisciplinary approach investigates the mathematical, architectural, and structural 
        aspects of folded structures, which help to understand how paper folding can be used as a 
        medium to solve structural and aesthetic problems. In this context, origami presents an 
        interface to gain cognitive experience on spatial configurations and form finding and acts 
        as an effective tool for further morphological explorations in the architectural design process. 
        Based on undertaking a data collection exercise with architecture students, origami has proved to 
        be a rich source of inspiration and has found its way into a wide range of design applications. It 
        has even led to the discovery of new forms and methods of construction. Origami paper, often referred 
        to as "kami" (Japanese for paper), is sold in prepackaged squares of various sizes ranging from 2.5 cm 
        (1 in) to 25 cm (10 in) or more. It is commonly colored on one side and white on the other; however, dual 
        coloured and patterned versions exist and can be used effectively for color-changed models. Origami paper 
        weighs slightly less than copy paper, making it suitable for a wider range of models.

        Normal copy paper with weights of 70–90 g/m2 can be used for simple folds, such as the crane and waterbomb. 
        Heavier weight papers of (19–24&nb 100 g/m2 (approx. 25 lb) or more can be wet-folded. This technique allows 
        for a more rounded sculpting of the model, which becomes rigid and sturdy when it is dry.</p>
